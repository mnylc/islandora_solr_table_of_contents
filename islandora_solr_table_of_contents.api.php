/**
 * Alters the default table of contents configuration.
 *
 * The configuration is an array whose keys are content model PIDs associated
 * with arrays, which can contain:
 * - nothing: in this case, the Table of Contents block will be rendered on
 *   object pages with this content model, but they are not considered to have
 *   children.
 * - 'solr_field': a field in Solr designating how children relate to objects
 *   with this content model (e.g., RELS_EXT_isMemberOfCollection_uri_ms would
 *   be used to find children of an islandora:collectionCModel object). This can
 *   be a field that returns a PID, or a field that returns an info:fedora URI.
 * - 'sort_field': an optional field to sort Solr results on. This won't do
 *   anything by itself.
 *
 * @param array $configuration
 *   The default configuration, passed in by reference.
